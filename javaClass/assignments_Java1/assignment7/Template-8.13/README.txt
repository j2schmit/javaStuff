Use the supplied .java file(s) as the basis of your solution to the assignment. Note that, for the purposes of this course, all classes are defined within the default package (in other words, they do not explicitly specify a package).

This assignment must be submitted as a .zip file containing only your solution's .java files named following the convention LastnameFirstInitialExercise#.zip where the '#' is the Exercise number.
For example, my submission for this assignment would be named DukeGExercise8.13.zip). There should be NO DIRECTORIES within the zip file.

Inclusion of the System.exit() method in your code negatively impacts the operation of the test suite and will result in a loss of credit. DO NOT use the System.exit() method in your solution.

In addition to the usual template code (IntegerSet.java) I have included a working command line test driver (IntegerSetTest.java) to aid in interactively manipulating IntegerSets and checking your work. Despite what the assignment prompt states in the text YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO WRITE YOUR OWN TEST DRIVER. Your assignment is to complete IntegerSet.java as per the assignment prompt. Your assignment submission should contain only IntegerSet.java. DO NOT submit IntegerSetTest.java.

As for the format of IntegerSet output…
An empty IntegerSet should be displayed as:
{ --- }
An integer set containing 5 and 10 should be displayed as:
{ 5 10 }

A unit test driver that bears a striking resemblance to the one I'll use to grade your assignment has also been made available. Please use that to check your assumptions and validate your work.
