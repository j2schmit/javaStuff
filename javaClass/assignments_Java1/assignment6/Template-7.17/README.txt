Use the supplied .java file(s) as the basis of your solution to the assignment. Note that, for the purposes of this course, all classes are defined within the default package (in other words, they do not explicitly specify a package).

This assignment must be submitted as a .zip file containing only your solution's .java files named following the convention LastnameFirstInitialExercise#.zip where the '#' is the Exercise number.
For example, my submission for this assignment would be named DukeGExercise7.17.zip). There should be NO DIRECTORIES within the zip file.

Inclusion of the System.exit() method in your code negatively impacts the operation of the test suite and will result in a loss of credit. DO NOT use the System.exit() method in your solution.

Note that your frequency values will vary each time the program is run and are not expected to exactly match those below. The tests will, however, verify that the distribution is correct and does not deviate too far from the expected values (probability, the nature of the Random class, and 36000000 "rolls" will ensure that, if properly coded, they almost certainly will not).

Expected program (RockNRollah) console (System.out) output:
Results after 36000000 rolls
